            <li>Obtaining Resonance
                <p> 
                    Resonance aka bell is a small bell you can unlock on your waist that activates a random useful ability when you ring it. 
                    You obtain it by beating enough bosses to fill your "bell xp bar" but that bar is invisible to the player and the only way to check
                    if you have enough for bell is getting knocked down in a dangerous place called The Depths.
