        <p> Deepwoken's lore centers on a fallen "Old World" devastated by humanity's misuse of "the Song," leading to cataclysmic "Tides"
        and emergence of the perilous "New World," filled with powerful factions, corrupted beings, and the mysterious Depths,
        all while players navigate islands, seek powerful artifacts, and uncover cosmic secrets involving Celestials, Shadowcasters,
        and the overarching threat of the god-like Ministry.</p>
